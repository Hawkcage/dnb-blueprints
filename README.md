# dnb-blueprints

### Analysis 

What I am doing here is subjetively analysing drum and bass tracks and noting in text what is happening in segments of 8 Bars (or less). The purpose here is to create a database of music concepts broken down to their core idea level.

Additionally I am looking to find a way to synthesize new concepts by experimentally combining different segments from different works. By taking two separate concepts and linking them (or combining, interchanging, crossing) I attempt to force the music production process to be guided in a different way. Instead of producing a song from start to finish organically, the process is guided by a blueprint which lays out how the song has to progress, what elements it has to have and etc. The producer then is tasked to create a music piece based on the blueprint that outlines the conceptual framework (described in text). I am hoping that this method of music production will remove unecessary doubts of -what to do- or -where to take this/how to progress- and push the thought process into -how to fulfill this requirement- leading to a boost in creativity and the generation of new original concepts.

### Generation

I will be synthesizing new original blueprints using the pool of analysed blueprints of other works. The aim here is to log what works and what does not and also to find blueprints, that can generate sucessfull tracks, or better - find a potent blueprint that can generate a 'family' of tracks, that can act as a core starting point for a certain type of music work and lead to the creation of a 'artistic signature'.
